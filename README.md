# XXZLearning

The code files in this folder are split into files associated with generating training states (ground states of the XYZ Hamiltonian) and testing meshes (meshes of ground
states) that will be used in the learning, and files which perform the machine learning itself and generate a learned phase diagram.

#### Training/Testing Files
<ul>
  <li> <code> Ham_XXZ_J3J6.m </code> </li>
  <li> <code> XXZtrain.m  </code> </li>
  <li> <code> XXZ_test_take2.m  </code> </li>
</ul>
